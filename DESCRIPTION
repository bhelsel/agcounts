Title: R Package for Extracting Actigraphy Counts from Accelerometer Data
Version: 0.2.3.9000
Author: Brian C. Helsel
Maintainer: The package maintainer <bhelsel80@gmail.com>
Description: This R Package reads the X, Y, and Z axes in a GT3X accelerometer file and converts it to Actigraphy counts.
    This work was inspired by Neishabouri et al. who published the article "Quantification of Acceleration as Activity Counts in ActiGraph Wearables" on February 24, 2022.
