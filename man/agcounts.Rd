\title{agcounts: R Package for Extracting Actigraphy Counts from Accelerometer Data.}
\description{
This R Package reads the X, Y, and Z axes in a GT3X accelerometer file
    and converts it to Actigraphy counts. This work was inspired by Neishabouri et al.
    who published the article "Quantification of Acceleration as Activity Counts in
    ActiGraph Wearables on February 24, 2022. The \href{https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1370418/v1}{link to the article}
    and Python implementation of this code \url{https://github.com/actigraph/agcounts}.
