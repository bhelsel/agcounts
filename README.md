This R Package reads the X, Y, and Z axes in a GT3X accelerometer file and converts it to Actigraphy counts. This work was inspired by Neishabouri et al. who released a preprint of "Quantification of Acceleration as Activity Counts in ActiGraph Wearables" on February 24, 2022. Here are the links to the <a href = https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1370418/v1>article</a> and <a href = https://github.com/actigraph/agcounts>Python implementation</a> of this code on GitHub.

### Install the `agcounts` package
```r
# Install the devtools package if it is not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Use the `install_github` function to download agcounts from GitHub
devtools::install_github("bhelsel/agcounts")
```
### Reading Files

##### Read in raw acceleration data and calculate ActiGraph counts

There are 3 ways to read in raw acceleration data using the `agcounts` package.
This is done by the `parser` argument from the `agread` function. This is an
exported function from the `agcounts` package but the user can also choose to
access `agread` via the `get_counts` function to read the data adn calculate 
counts. The preferred `parser` method is to use the calibrated reader from 
ActiGraph's <a href = https://github.com/actigraph/pygt3x>pygt3x</a> Python 
module. This requires the user to ensure that Python version â‰¥ 3.8 is installed. 
We recommend the user load the `reticulate` package to install python and the 
pygt3x module by following these steps.

```r

library(reticulate)

# Install miniconda and restart your R session
reticulate::install_miniconda()

# Run py_config() to ensure that you have a python version available
# This will also initialize the r-reticulate virtual environment
py_config()

# Install pygt3x from Gitub using pip
py_install("pygt3x", pip = TRUE)

# Check to see if the pygt3x installation worked
py_list_packages()

```

You can also choose to use the `ggir` parser from the
<a href=https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR>GGIR</a> package. No additional 
configuration is needed except for ensuring the GGIR package is installed. 
Currently, this is the slowest way to calibrate data but can handle non-ActiGraph
files. Finally, the `read.gt3x::read.gt3x` can be used to read in uncalibrated data.
If the user is working with an ActiGraph device, we have also included a C++ version
of the `ggir` parser that offers calibration at an improved speed.

### Calculate Counts

`calculate_counts` is the main function in the `agcounts` package.

##### Read and Convert a single GT3X file to ActiGraph counts

```r
# path = "Full pathname to the GT3X file", e.g.:

path = system.file("extdata/example.gt3x", package = "agcounts")

# Ensure that the r-reticulate virtual environment has been activated.
# This may not be necessary based on your Python configuration and how you installed the python packages.

reticulate::use_virtualenv("r-reticulate")

library(agcounts)

# Using the default pygt3x reader because pygt3x is installed
epochs_pygt3x <- 
  agread(path, parser = "pygt3x") %>%
  calculate_counts(epoch = 60)
  
# GGIR calibrated reader
epochs_ggir <- 
  agread(path, parser = "ggir") %>%
  calculate_counts(epoch = 60)
  
# GGIR C++ calibrated reader
epochs_agcalibrate <-
  read.gt3x::read.gt3x(path, asDataFrame = TRUE, imputeZeros = FALSE) %>%
  agcalibrate() %>%
  calculate_counts(epoch = 60)
  
# Uncalibrated raw acceleration data
epochs_uncalibrated <-
  agread(path, parser = "uncalibrated") %>%
  calculate_counts(epoch = 60)
  

```

### Get Counts

The `get_counts` function is the wrapper function for `calculate_counts` that
also reads in the data using `agread` and one of the listed methods. 

```r
path = system.file("extdata/example.gt3x", package = "agcounts")
get_counts(path = path, epoch = 60, write.file = FALSE, return.data = TRUE, parser = "pygt3x")
```

### Writing Files

##### Read and convert a single GT3X file to ActiGraph counts exported to a CSV file

We also offer a `write.file` argument that will read, convert, and export the
Actigraph count data to a CSV file in the same directory.

```r
# path = "Full pathname to the GT3X file", e.g.:
path = system.file("extdata/example.gt3x", package = "agcounts")

get_counts(path = path, epoch = 60, write.file = TRUE, return.data = FALSE, parser = "pygt3x")
```

##### Read and convert multiple GT3X files to ActiGraph counts exported a CSV file

We can extend the `write.file` argument by passing the path name of several GT3X
files to an `apply` function.

```r
folder = "Full pathname to the folder where the GT3X files are stored"

files = list.files(path = folder, pattern = ".gt3x", full.names = TRUE)

sapply(files, get_counts, epoch = 60, write.file = TRUE, return.data = FALSE, parser = "pygt3x")
```

To speed up processing time, the parallel package may be a useful addition to
the `write.file` argument. Here is sample code that can be adjusted based on 
each user's computer and R configurations.

```r
folder = "Full pathname to the folder where the GT3X files are stored"

files = list.files(path = folder, pattern = ".gt3x", full.names = TRUE)

cores = parallel::detectCores()

Ncores = cores - 1

cl = parallel::makeCluster(Ncores)

doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)

`%dopar%` = foreach::`%dopar%`

foreach::foreach(i = files, .packages = "agcounts") %dopar% {
  get_counts(path = i, epoch = 60, write.file = TRUE, return.data = FALSE, parser = "pygt3x")
}

parallel::stopCluster(cl)

```
